After spending five years bouncing around various communications roles, I decided to take on the challenge of becoming a full-stack web developer. I enrolled in Actualize, and it has been the best decision I’ve ever made! I can’t wait to leverage all that I’ve learned in a full-time position where I can combine my background in writing with my coding skills.', linkedin_url: 'linkedin.com/in/kassiashishkoff', twitter_handle: 'kassia.shishkoff', blog_url: 'wordpress.com/kassia', resume_url: 'indeed.com/kassia', github_url: 'github.com/kassia', photo: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Spongebob-squarepants.svg/666px-Spongebob-squarepants.svg.png'}])
